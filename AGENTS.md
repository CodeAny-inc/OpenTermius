# AGENTS.md — project notes for AI assistants working on OpenTermius

## Build & run
- Desktop: `cd desktop && npm install && npm run tauri dev`
- Rust not yet installed in dev env; install via rustup first.
- Workspace root is the repo root; `cargo build` from root builds core + desktop.

## Verification
- `cargo check --workspace` after core changes.
- `cargo test -p opentermius-core` once tests are added.
- Tauri build: `cd desktop && npm run tauri build`.
- Frontend typecheck: `cd desktop && npx vue-tsc --noEmit`.

## Building distributable versions
- Local build (current platform only): `cd desktop && npm run tauri build`
  - macOS: produces `.dmg` + `.app` in `desktop/src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`
  - Linux: produces `.deb`, `.AppImage`, `.rpm`
  - Windows: produces `.msi` + `.exe` (NSIS)
- Cross-platform releases via GitHub Actions:
  - Push a tag `v0.1.0` → triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  - Builds on macOS (arm64 + x86_64), Linux, Windows runners
  - Signs update packages with `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` secret
  - Publishes artifacts + `latest.json` to GitHub Releases
  - Automatically detects prereleases (alpha/beta/rc in version)

## Release automation

### Local release script: `scripts/release.sh`
Automates the entire local release process for macOS (current platform):
```bash
# Release next alpha (bumps version, builds, signs, uploads)
./scripts/release.sh alpha

# Release a specific version
./scripts/release.sh 0.2.0

# Release current version with custom notes
./scripts/release.sh --notes "Fixed critical bug"

# Dry run (see what would happen without executing)
./scripts/release.sh --dry-run alpha

# Skip checks (faster, use with caution)
./scripts/release.sh --skip-checks alpha
```
The script: checks prerequisites → bumps version → runs checks → builds →
creates DMG + tarball → signs tarball → generates latest.json → commits,
tags, pushes → creates GitHub release with all assets.

### Version management: `scripts/version.sh`
```bash
./scripts/version.sh              # print current version
./scripts/version.sh 0.1.2        # set to 0.1.2
./scripts/version.sh patch        # 0.1.1 -> 0.1.2
./scripts/version.sh minor        # 0.1.1 -> 0.2.0
./scripts/version.sh major        # 0.1.1 -> 1.0.0
./scripts/version.sh alpha        # 0.1.1-alpha.9 -> 0.1.1-alpha.10
./scripts/version.sh beta         # 0.1.1 -> 0.1.1-beta.1
./scripts/version.sh stable       # 0.1.1-alpha.9 -> 0.1.1
```
Updates version in Cargo.toml, package.json, and tauri.conf.json.

### GitHub Actions: `.github/workflows/release.yml`
Triggers on tag push (`v*.*.*`) or manual dispatch.
- Builds on macOS (arm64 + x86_64), Linux, Windows in parallel
- Signs all bundles with `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` (requires `createUpdaterArtifacts: true` in tauri.conf.json)
- Auto-detects prerelease (alpha/beta/rc in version string)
- Generates `latest.json` with all platform signatures
- Uploads everything to the GitHub release

## Auto-update
- Uses `tauri-plugin-updater` (configured in `tauri.conf.json` under `plugins.updater`)
- **Important**: The endpoint in `tauri.conf.json` is only a fallback. The actual
  update check uses a custom implementation in `commands.rs` that queries the
  GitHub API (`/releases` endpoint) to find the newest release — **including
  prereleases**. GitHub's `releases/latest` redirect excludes prereleases, so
  the default Tauri updater endpoint doesn't work for alpha/beta releases.
- The custom check (`check_with_prerelease_endpoint`):
  1. Calls `https://api.github.com/repos/CodeAny-inc/OpenTermius/releases`
  2. Parses all release tags as semver versions
  3. Picks the highest version that has a `latest.json` asset
  4. Builds a Tauri updater with that release's `latest.json` URL as the endpoint
  5. The plugin handles download, signature verification, and installation
- App checks for updates on startup (release builds only, silent)
- Frontend shows `UpdateBanner` when an update is available
- User clicks "Download & Restart" → downloads, verifies signature, installs, restarts
- Signing key: private key is a GitHub secret (`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY`),
  public key is embedded in `tauri.conf.json`

## Required GitHub secrets for releases
- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` — the base64 private key (from `tauri signer generate`)
- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` — empty string if key has no password

## macOS code signing
- The app is currently ad-hoc signed (`signingIdentity: "-"` in tauri.conf.json).
- Without an Apple Developer ID certificate, macOS shows "damaged app" when
  downloaded from the internet. Users fix with: `xattr -cr /Applications/OpenTermius.app`
- To enable proper signing + notarization, set these env vars before building:
  - `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` — Developer ID Application certificate name
  - `APPLE_ID` — Apple ID email
  - `APPLE_PASSWORD` — app-specific password (from appleid.apple.com)
  - `APPLE_TEAM_ID` — Developer Team ID
- Or use an API key:
  - `APPLE_API_KEY` — App Store Connect API key
  - `APPLE_API_ISSUER` — Issuer ID
  - `APPLE_API_KEY_PATH` — path to API key file

## Git author config
- All commits must be authored by `computerbox124 <computerbox124@users.noreply.github.com>`.
- Local git config is set via `git config user.name` and `git config user.email`.
- NEVER attribute commits to Devin or any AI agent.

## Conventions
- All SSH/crypto logic lives in `core/`, never in shells.
- Private key material must be wrapped to `Zeroize` on drop.
- Host key mismatches never auto-accept; surface to user.
- No secrets in logs; no plaintext keys on disk; vault is the only persisted form.
- Pin dependency versions (no floating `latest` / `*`).

## Git conventions
- NEVER mention, attribute, or add a co-author trailer for Devin or any AI
  agent in commit messages. No "Generated with Devin", no
  "Co-Authored-By: Devin", no AI attribution of any kind. Commits should look
  like they were written by the human author only.
- Commit messages: concise, focus on "why" not "what".

## Architecture
See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. One Rust core, Tauri desktop shell now, mobile
via FFI later.
