//! OpenTermius shared core.
//!
//! Platform-agnostic logic shared by the Tauri desktop app and future mobile
//! frontends via FFI. Contains:
//! - connection & host models
//! - SSH transport (russh) + session management
//! - key parsing / generation (russh-keys)
//! - encrypted-at-rest vault for private keys
//! - known_hosts verification (TOFU)
//! - workspace & layout persistence
//!
//! Security rules enforced here, not in the UI layer:
//! - private key material is zeroized on drop
//! - vault ciphertext is the only thing ever persisted to disk
//! - host key mismatches never auto-accept
